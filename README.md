Frames are an innovative way to add functionality to Farcaster casts.

Check out the frame specification here: https://docs.farcaster.xyz/reference/frames/spec

Use these mini-projects to explore Farcaster Frames - just single file html and javascript - no extras.

Frame 1. This is a simple as it gets - a background picture and a single button that takes you to a link. We're using Github pages to deploy the pages - probably the easiest way for simpler frames.

Suggestions and observations appreciated!
